description: Minigalaxy is a client for downloading and playing games purchased on the GOG game store on Linux. When I started this project, the only other option was Lutris, so people quickly adopted the easy to use Minigalaxy. It has been downloaded at least tens of thousands of times. The project has grown with contributions from over 50 different people and it got translated into over 20 different languages. Minigalaxy is available in the official repositories of most Linux distributions.
