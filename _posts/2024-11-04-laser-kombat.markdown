description: Laser Kombat was a freeware game I used to play in my childhood of which I had fond memories. In 2021 I asked the original developer if he still has the source code and surprisingly he open sourced an early version of it in response. I ported this version to SDL and added support for gamepads to it. After which I implemented all the features that were still missing which were available in the last release. Now Laser Kombat is once again playable on modern computers.
