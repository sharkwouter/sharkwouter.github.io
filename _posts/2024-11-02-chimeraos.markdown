description: ChimeraOS is a SteamOS like operating system with more up-to-date internals and a boat load of extra features. I contributed heavily to it in its initial phases. I introduced the installation ISOs to the project and wrote a significant amount of features for the web interface, like setting ssh keys, authentication support and installing applications from the Flathub website.
